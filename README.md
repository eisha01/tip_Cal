# tip_Cal
Tip calculator android app developed using Kotlin and material Design
This Android App (Tip_calculator) has been build using Kotlin and material design (for interactive user interface). Main objective of this app is to calculate tip which includes 
TextInput and TextInputEditText and Radio Buttons for the user input. In the MainActivity we have created a function named CalculateTip() which stores the userinput into a variable and we have used CheckedRadioButtons method to perform operation on radio buttons.
Then in the oncreate method we have called ClickListener method on the calculate Button which we have created in the activitymain and have passed the CalculateTip function to it. So whenever we click on that button the calculateTip function would be called.
